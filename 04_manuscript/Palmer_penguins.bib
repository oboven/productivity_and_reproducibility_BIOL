  abstract = {Climate change is leading to phenological shifts across a wide range of species globally. Polar oceans are hotspots of rapid climate change where sea ice dynamics structure ecosystems and organismal life cycles are attuned to ice seasonality. To anticipate climate change impacts on populations and ecosystem services, it is critical to understand ecosystem phenology to determine species activity patterns, optimal environmental windows for processes like reproduction, and the ramifications of ecological mismatches. Since 1991, the Palmer Antarctica Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has monitored seasonal dynamics near Palmer Station. Here, we review the species that occupy this region as year-round residents, seasonal breeders, or periodic visitors. We show that sea ice retreat and increasing photoperiod in the spring trigger a sequence of events from mid-November to mid-February, including Ad\'elie penguin clutch initiation, snow melt, calm conditions (low winds and warm air/sea temperature), phytoplankton blooms, shallow mixed layer depths, particulate organic carbon flux, peak humpback whale abundances, nutrient drawdown, and bacterial accumulation. Subsequently, from May to June, snow accumulates, zooplankton indicator species appear, and sea ice advances. The standard deviation in the timing of most events ranged from \textasciitilde 20 to 45 days, which was striking compared with Ad\'elie penguin clutch initiation that varied {$<$}1 week. In general, during late sea ice retreat years, events happened later (\textasciitilde 5 to {$>$}30 days) than mean dates and the variability in timing was low ({$<$}20\%) compared with early ice retreat years. Statistical models showed the timing of some events were informative predictors (but not sole drivers) of other events. From an Ad\'elie penguin perspective, earlier sea ice retreat and shifts in the timing of suitable conditions or prey characteristics could lead to mismatches, or asynchronies, that ultimately influence chick survival via their mass at fledging. However, more work is needed to understand how phenological shifts affect chick thermoregulatory costs and the abundance, availability, and energy content of key prey species, which support chick growth and survival. While we did not detect many long-term phenological trends, we expect that when sea ice trends become significant within our LTER time series, phenological trends and negative effects from ecological mismatches will follow.},

  abstract = {In 1935, Edgar Anderson collected size measurements for 150 flowers from three species of Iris on the Gasp\'e Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. Since then, Anderson's Iris observations have become a classic dataset in statistics, machine learning, and data science teaching materials. It is included in the base R datasets package as iris, making it easy for users to access without knowing much about it. However, the lack of data documentation, presence of non-intuitive variables (e.g. "sepal width"), and perfectly balanced groups with zero missing values make iris an inadequate and stale dataset for teaching and learning modern data science skills. Users would benefit from working with a more representative, real-world environmental dataset with a clear link to current scientific research. Importantly, Anderson's Iris data appeared in a 1936 publication by R. A. Fisher in the Annals of Eugenics (which is often the first-listed citation for the dataset), inextricably linking iris to eugenics research. Thus, a modern alternative to iris is needed. In this paper, we introduce the palmerpenguins R package (Horst et al., 2020), which includes body size measurements collected from 2007 - 2009 for three species of Pygoscelis penguins that breed on islands throughout the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The penguins dataset in palmerpenguins provides an approachable, charismatic, and near drop-in replacement for iris with topical relevance for polar climate change and environmental impacts on marine predators. Since the release on CRAN in July 2020, the palmerpenguins package has been downloaded over 462,000 times, highlighting the demand and widespread adoption of this viable iris alternative. We directly compare the iris and penguins datasets for selected analyses to demonstrate that R users, in particular teachers and learners currently using iris, can switch to the Palmer Archipelago penguins for many use cases including data wrangling, visualization, linear modeling, multivariate analysis (e.g., PCA), cluster analysis and classification (e.g., by k-means).},

  abstract = {The Palmer Deep canyon along the West Antarctic Peninsula is a biological hotspot with abundant phytoplankton and krill supporting Ad\'elie and gentoo penguin rookeries at the canyon head. Nearshore studies have focused on physical mechanisms driving primary production and penguin foraging, but less is known about finer-scale krill distribution and density. We designed two acoustic survey grids paired with conductivity\textendash temperature\textendash depth profiles within adjacent Ad\'elie and gentoo penguin foraging regions near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The grids were sampled from January to March 2019 to assess variability in krill availability and associations with oceanographic properties. Krill density was similar in the two regions, but krill swarms were longer and larger in the gentoo foraging region, which was also less stratified and had lower chlorophyll concentrations. In the inshore zone near penguin colonies, depth-integrated krill density increased from summer to autumn (January\textendash March) independent of chlorophyll concentration, suggesting a life history-driven adult krill migration rather than a resource-driven biomass increase. The daytime depth of krill biomass deepened through the summer and became decoupled from the chlorophyll maximum in March as diel vertical migration magnitude likely increased. Penguins near Palmer Station did not appear to be limited by krill availability during our study, and regional differences in krill depth match the foraging behaviors of the two penguin species. Understanding fine-scale physical forcing and ecological interactions in coastal Antarctic hotspots is critical for predicting how environmental change will impact these ecosystems.},
