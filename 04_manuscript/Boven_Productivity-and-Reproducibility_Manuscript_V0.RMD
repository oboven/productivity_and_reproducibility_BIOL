#Introduction

This short project focuses on the widely used 'palmerpenguins' package @horstPalmerArchipelagoPenguins2022 with the intention of making an entirely reproducible workflow.

This is my manuscript, which would probably include sections such as Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion.
